HALF_MK_ABS - PPLAMBDA rule, (in)equivalent function and abstraction

HALF_MK_ABS: thm -> thm

     !x. u x =< t
   ----------------
       u =< \x.t

This rule may be seen as converting the function/argument definition style
into the lambda definition style.  The symbol  =< stands for either of the
relations == or <<, the same at each occurence within the rule.
