prove_thm - solves a goal using a tactic, stores a theorem

prove_thm: (string * form * tactic) -> thm

Proves a goal using a theorem (like TAC_PROOF), then saves it on the current
theory file.  Useful in batch files that create theories.  Prints any goals
that the tactic leaves unsolved.

tactic fails
tactic returns a non-empty subgoal list
validation fails
