help -- directory of on-line documentation

This directory contains the information for the entries in help.
help : string -> unit is available as a function in LCF.

This directory is currently out of date.  It contains the help files from the
old Cambridge LCF system.  Some new features are undocumented and some old ML
syntax is used.

This Help Directory contains the following files

*.hlp -- help entries 
Makefile -- to make lcf.kwic and subjects.hlp
unsorted-lcf.kwic -- unsorted keyword file for LCF
lcf.kwic -- sorted keyword file
ml-mode.mlisp -- Gosling Emacs file implementing an "ML/LCF" mode
Readme -- this file

The unsorted file is organized by "concept" (namely location of definition in
the source files).  The sorted file is alphabetic.  I am not sure which is
more useful.  The unsorted file is the master.  Type "make" after editing
any Help files.

The Emacs ML mode (ml-mode.mlisp) is unsupported, because of the many different
versions in existence.  It is based on a simple idea, so local Emacs experts
should have no problems modifying it to work on their system.

Be sure to keep this on-line documentation up-to-date if you extend the
system!  If you change unsorted-lcf.kwic or add/delete help files, run the
script build.sh afterwards.

The help files have long names.  Though Unix 4.1 truncates filenames to 14
characters, nearly all of the files are unique in the first 14 characters, so
the Help system should work.  If you later switch to a Unix that allows longer
filenames, you must extend these filenames to the new limit; otherwise the
Help system will not find them.  The easiest way to switch is to read the
LCF distribution tape again: so save this tape.
