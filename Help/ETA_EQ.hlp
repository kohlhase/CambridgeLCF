ETA_EQ	- PPLAMBDA theorem, eta-conversion

ETA_EQ : thm


|-`!f:'a -> 'b. \x.(f:'a -> 'b) x == f:'a -> 'b`

It may seem surprising that eta-conversion can be expressed as a theorem,
since it involves the syntactic condition that x not appear free in f.
However, the instances of this theorem all satisfy that condition.
