VALID	- tactical, fails if tactic's result is invalid (approximate test)

VALID: tactic -> tactic

The tactical VALID constructs (usually) valid tactics.  It applies tac to the
goal, then tests the resulting validation on dummy theorems.  If the resulting
theorem differs from the goal, or contains additional assumptions, then VALID
fails; otherwise it returns the goal list and validation.  VALID uses chktac,
which is imperfect but fairly reliable.
