INDUCT_TAC - tactic, computation induction, checks admissibility

INDUCT_TAC: (thm list) -> (term * term)list -> tactic
	    type thms	   funi   fi


            A(FIX fun1, ..., FIX funn)
======================================================
			A(UU)   
!f1...fn. A(f1, ..., fn)  ==>  A(fun1 f1, ..., funn fn)


Uses type theorems and TR_CASES in testing admissability, as described in
the PPLAMBDA reference manual.
