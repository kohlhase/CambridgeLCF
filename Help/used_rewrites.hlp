used_rewrites - lists theorems in canonical form for rewriting

used_rewrites: (thm list) -> (thm list * thm list)

This function is helpful for predicting the effect
of rewriting.
It processes the list of theorems 
as the rewriting tactics do --
puts the theorems into canonical form,
and classifies them as term rewrites, formula rewrites,
or unsuitable for rewriting.
The output consists of the list of term rewrites,
paired with the list of formula rewrites.
