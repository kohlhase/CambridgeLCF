EVERY	- sequencing tactical, applies every tactic in succession

EXAMPLE

	EVERY [tac1, tac2, tac3]

This is equivalent to 

	tac1 THEN (tac2 THEN (tac3 THEN ALL_TAC))

Stylistically, EVERY plays a similar role to an Algol 'begin-end' block.
It is more useful when applied to a function that produces a list of tactics.
