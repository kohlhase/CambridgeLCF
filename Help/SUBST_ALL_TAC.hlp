SUBST_ALL_TAC - tactic, substitutes in goal and assumptions

SUBST_ALL_TAC: thm -> tactic
	      |-t==u

      [ AL(t) ] B(t)
    ==================
      [ AL(u) ] B(u)


The symbol AL stands for the entire assumption list.  SUBST_ALL_TAC breaches
the style of natural deduction, where the assumptions are kept fixed.
However, the tactic is valid and occasionally useful.
