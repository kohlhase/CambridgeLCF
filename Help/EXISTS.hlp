Exists introduction

	A(t)
    -------------
       ?x.A(x)


You must tell the rule what its conclusion should look like, since it is
rarely desirable to replace EVERY t by x.  For example, you can conclude two
different results from the theorem `|-TT==TT`:

EXISTS (`?x. x==TT`, `TT`)  (`|-TT==TT`)   --->  |-?x. x==TT

or

EXISTS (`?x. x==x`, `TT`)  (`|-TT==TT`)   --->  |-?x. x==x
