FORALL_LEFT_TAC - tactic, instantiates universal assumption (forall)

FORALL_LEFT_TAC: term*term -> tactic

      [ !x.A ] C
=======================
      [ A[t/x] ] C

The tactic FORALL_LEFT_TAC implements the sequent rule forall-left.  Given a
variable x and a goal, it searches for an assumption of the form ?x.A for the
same x.  It makes a new assumption A[t/x].

Another universal elimination tactic is SPEC_TAC.
