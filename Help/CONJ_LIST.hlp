CONJ_LIST - derived rule, breaks conjunction into theorem list

CONJ_LIST : int -> thm -> thm list

CONJ_LIST n `|- A1 /\ (...(... /\ An)...)`   ---> 
	      [ `|-A1`,..., `|-An`]


      A1 /\ ... /\ An
    -------------------		where n>0
	 A1 ... An


This is a (reliable) inverse of LIST_CONJ : it flattens only right conjuncts.
You must specify n, since An could itself be a conjunction.  Mainly useful for
ML programming.
