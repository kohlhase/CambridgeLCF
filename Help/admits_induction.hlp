admits_induction - tests if formula admits induction given type properties

admits_induction : (thm list -> form -> term -> bool)
			thl       A       x

Given a list of theorems stating finiteness or chain-finiteness of types,
admits_induction tests whether the formula `A` admits fixed-point induction in
the variable `x`.  Admissability is discussed in the book
