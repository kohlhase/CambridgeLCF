=======================
      [ A[x'/x] ] B

The tactic EXISTS_LEFT_TAC implements the sequent rule exists-left.  It
searches for an assumption of the form ?x.A and replaces it by A[x'/x], where
x' is a variant of x not free in ?x.A, B, or the assumptions.  Exists
elimination is also provided with STRIP_THM_TAC.
