Directory Examples contains sample theories that can be used to test LCF.  They
can also be used as the basis of other proofs.  These theories of numbers,
lists, equality, fixed points and sequences forms a much richer starting base
than pure PPLAMBDA.  Different choices are possible, e.g. between strict or
lazy lists.

The Makefile can be used to make the standard theories and also to test the 
system.  If you have just built lcf on directory Franz, the command
	make LCF=../Franz/lcf > testlog & 
will use the new lcf to build all the theories.  You can then inspect file
testlog for error messages.

A files named XXX-ld.ml contains commands to load the theories constructed in 
the corresponding file XXX.ml.  

Before loading a file to build a theory X, you must delete the theory file
X.th, since LCF will refuse to overwrite it.
